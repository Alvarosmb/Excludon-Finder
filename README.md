# Operon-Finder
Easy to use pipeline for Non-contiguous operon annnotation using Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing

The code used in this project is adapted from (https://github.com/HPCBio/lasa-ONT-2022June) created by Lindsay Clark (https://github.com/lvclark). The original code has been modified to create a more general pipeline that requires only input and uses a conda environment to simplify usage.
